        This game is played on a vertical board wich has seven hollow columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides.
        <br>
        In short, itÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.
        <br>
        Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different colour. The board is empty at the start of the game.
